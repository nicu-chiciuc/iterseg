## Cloudflare Worker Previews

Workers Builds runs `pnpm run build`, then `pnpm run deploy` for the production
branch or `pnpm run deploy:preview` for other branches. The preview command uses
native Worker Previews with the installed Wrangler version. The empty `previews` config keeps
this app assets-only; no Convex keys or runtime secrets are required.

For an existing Worker, first use **Settings > Builds > Set up Worker Previews**
and restore the commands above after Cloudflare replaces the preview command.
Keep the existing build root and enable non-production branch builds. Verify the
new preview URL and application before completing the rollout.

Build before any manual deploy. To check the production package without an upload,
run `pnpm exec wrangler deploy --dry-run` after the build.
Worker Previews has no dry-run mode.
See the [Worker Previews configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/previews/configuration/)
and [existing Worker setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/build-branches/#existing-workers-connected-to-builds).
